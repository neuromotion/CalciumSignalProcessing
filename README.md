# CalciumSignalProcessing

This code should be used after the calcium signal has been extracted using the FluoroSNNAP software (Patel et al, 2015). The code calculates the correlation matrix, the average correlation, and extracts the whole tissue firing rate from the processed_analaysis.mat file produced from the FluoroSNNAP analysis.
